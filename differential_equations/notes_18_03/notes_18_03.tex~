\subsubsection{Differential Equations \& Separability}

In the the first part of the course, we will only study ODEs involving the first derivative:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:firstorderode}
  y' = F(x, y)
\end{equation}

Example:
\begin{equation}
  y' = 2x,
\end{equation}

which has solution $x^2 + C$. Such a solution is called the \textbf{general solution}\index{general solution}.

Another example \textit{(memorize this!)}:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:naturalgrowth}
  y' = kx
\end{equation}

With general solution $y = Ce^{kx}$. This will be a central example in the course; in fact, a reasonable defintion of the function $e^x$ is that it is the solution to the differential equation $y' = y$ such that $y(1) = 0$.

Separation of variables\index{separation of variables} will also be important. The protocol is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pull all variables to either side.
\item Integrate.
\item Amalgamate all constants and solve (if possible) for $y$ in terms of $x$.
\end{enumerate}

Most real-life equations aren't solvable, though. So, we often resort to graphical/numerical methods.

\subsubsection{Graphical Methods}

The differential equation $y' = F(x, y)$ defines a slope at every point in the plane. This is a \textbf{direction field}\index{direction field} or \textbf{slope field}\index{slope field}.

A \textbf{solution}\index{solution} of a differential equation is a function whose graph has the given slope at every point it goes through.

To specify a particular solution of an ODE you must give an \textbf{initial condition}\index{initial condition}: when $x$ takes on a certain value, $y$ takes on a specified value.
